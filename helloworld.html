    <h1>Current Pet Introductions</h1>
    <h2>DAHLIA</h2>
    <p>is our chubby, short legged, wide chested rescue Pitbull mix. She is between seven and eight years old, with a calm, yet skidish demeanor. Belly rubs are a must once you've made proper friends, but if you'd like other options, she accepts chin scritches, ear rubs, and butt scratches as well. She enjoys leisurely lounging on your bed pillows while expecting to be fully covered up at bedtime. As an older and hefty broad, she requires frequent snacks and water breaks, lots of naps, and prefers indoor living to outdoor nearly all the time. For a vicious murder dog, she is surprisingly sweet! She loves babies of all kinds, be it her chickens, which she has raised since they were chicks, her kittens, which love her as much as she loves them, or our neices and nephews, who love to pet and play with her while feeding her snacks.</p>
    <h2>NUGGET</h2>
    <p>is our oldest feline, at around two years old. He is a domestic longhair who was rescued from a Dollar Store dumpster he had been eating from. He is a true narcisist; his personality is calm, even, and he is easily adaptable to any situation, as long as you don't mind him telling you all about it. Yes, you guessed it, he's a yowler! Bowl of pebbles is half empty? YOWL! Dog door is closed but he want to be outside? YOOOWWWLLL!!! You are typing on your laptop? Too bad, he needs attention, now! YOWL! He enjoys spending most of his time outdoors, but is careful to come home every night to eat unlimited kitten kibbles and make sure we still love him.</p>
    <h2>'LIL MEANIE</h2>
    <p>has just turned thirteen weeks old and he is filled with pure kitten energy and pure kitten sleeps. He is a domestic shorthair and has the best grey and black tiger striping with spots on his belly. He came from a farm and greenhouse and has been living inside only, as he is very small and the chickens might eat him if he were in the yard at this size. As a very loving and sociable kitten, he enjoys rubbing faces with you, climbing on all the furniture, hiding in his crinkly tunnel, scratching at the cat posts, and generally bringing chaos into whatever room of the house he's in at the time.</p>
